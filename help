WHAT THE TOOL DOES

Posty is a tool that will auto post for you every 30 mins. You can provide it a list of meme pages to pull memes off of to repost. Its pretty straight forward.
If the meme page you provide is private then the account auto reposting MUST be following the private page for the bot to work correctly. 

LOGGING IN

This part is a little cmplicated and will require multiple steps. 
1. On your PC or Mac or whatever go to "https://instagram.com" on google chrome
2. Right click and select the Inspect option at the bottom.
3. Select the Network tab on the top | Pic https://imgur.com/a/oehR3c1
4. Now Select the Preserver Logs box | Pic https://imgur.com/a/MqJ1aMp
5. Now login to your Instagram account on the left side. Once its logged in go back on the right side where the Inspect page is and look for /ajax request | https://imgur.com/a/fPox1rH
6. Scroll all the way down the page to the form data section | Pic https://imgur.com/a/F6ZdkH8
7. Copy the enc_password data parameter. Pic https://imgur.com/a/xyNbeBg, it looks like this

8. Select option 2 on the tool to login. The username is normal but for the encoded password paste the copied value you got from the Inspect page. 
If it logged in then you did it correctly, otherwise make sure 2 factor is disabled and the enc_password was coppied correctly.

MONITORED PAGES

Option 3 will open a notepad with all the monitored memepages. You can add or remove ones you want there. If its a private page the logged in account needs to be following it.
There should only be one page per line. Make sure to save when finished.

CAPTIONS

Option 4 will open a notepad with all the captions to use when posting. One will randomly be chosen per post. Make sure to save when all are added.

BLACKLISTED CAPTIONS

Option 5 will open a notepad with all blacklisted captions to look out for. This is to try to reduce how mnay ads the bot will repost from larger pages. For example 
lots of meme pages like posting near nude girls with the caption "her @ is" then her username or whatever. As a blacklisted caption just put her @ is and the bot will
skip the repost.

STARTING THE BOT

Once you have an account logged in, monitored pages set, and captions set you can use option 6 to start the bot. From then it will post every 30 mins
